# Version control

Execute this command in your projects folder :

* `cp my_plans.txt my_plans.txt.backup`
* `cat /dev/null > my_plans.txt`

Reopen the `my_plans.txt` file. What happened? No! Your file is empty!

## Prevent losing documents

By using version control you can stop losing changes to files.

In your `planning` folder in a terminal window type in `git`. It should be installed on your PC. You should see all the various options & commands `git` have.

## `git` setup

In your `planning` folder type:

* `git status` it should tell you your folder is not a `git` repository
* `git init` to create a new local git repository in the `planning` folder
* `git status` to see what is going on. You should see some untracked files.
* `git add .` to add all the local files into git
* `git status` to see what is going on. There should be some files to commit now.
* `git commit -m ‘initial commit’ ` to add the files into the local repository.

Now repair the damage in the `my_plans.txt` file, put your plans back into the file.

There is a backup file called `my_plans.txt.backup` after you are happy with the contents of `my_plans.txt` delete `my_plans.txt.backup`. Use the `rm my_plans.txt.backup` command.

Now add all your changes to git.

## Add & commit your changes into git:

Before you will be able to commit your changes run this command in the terminal:

 `git config --global user.email "<PUT YOU EMAIL HERE>"`

Be sure to replace the `<PUT YOU EMAIL HERE>` with your email address.

Now add your changes to git:

* `git add .` to add all your changes to git.
* `git commit -m ‘put changes back’` to commit the changes.
* `git status` should show there are no pending changes or uncommitted files.

## Why is it called git:

It's name after it's creator [a grumpy old guy](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Git-get-its-name) - called [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)

## Getting changes back

Execute this command:

* `cat /dev/null > my_plans.txt` the file should be empty again
* execute `git status` you should see that git realizes that the file changed
* and the `my_plans.txt` file should be empty again! Sigh!

To get the file contents back type in `git stash` - this move recent changes to your files to the side.

Open `my_plans.txt` - the data from earlier should be in the file again. Yeah! Git to the rescue.

The next step would be to link the local git repository to a remote repository. This way changes are stored safely in the internet and if things goes wrong previous versions of files can be retrieved. You will learn about this soon.

Git is not only for storing and tracking your files, but it's main goal is to allow multiple people to work on the same files at the same time. You will learn about that as well in the near future.

## Learn more

Try out git [online at github](http://try.github.com)

Now learn more about git by completing the [git-it](http://jlord.us/git-it/) tutorial. Type `git-it` in the terminal to get going.

Only do the first `6 exercises` up until `Fork and clones`.
