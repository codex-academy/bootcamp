# More data

The work you done so far was around a list of call durations. In reality when you are making a phone call more data is involved.

Such as:

* the number dialed
* the duration of the call
* the direction of the call - whether it's an inbound or an outbound call
* who the service provider is MTN, Vodacom or CellC for example

We need to find a way of enriching call data so that you can store all the above information for each call. That is exactly what Objects are for.

An object that models a call look like this:

```javascript

var callOneData = {
    number : '0825004000',
    duration : 37,
    direction : 'inbound',
    serviceProvider : 'MTN'
};

```

To access the duration data you need to access it via the `callOneData` object like this:

```javascript
console.log(callOneData.duration);
```

Accessing the properties of an object that is in a list looks like this:

```javascript

//example call list
var callList = [/* list of calls */];

console.log(callList[0].duration);
console.log(callList[0].direction));
console.log(callList[0].serviceProvider));

```

## Use objects

Now practice using some objects using this dataset:

```javascript
var userCalls = [ { duration : 41,
                    number : '0836138901',
                    direction : 'inbound',
                    serviceProvider : 'MTN'},
                  { duration : 17,
                    number : '0826901234',
                    direction : 'outbound',
                    serviceProvider : 'MTN'},
                  { duration : 41,
                    number : '0761505671',
                    direction : 'inbound',
                    serviceProvider : 'MTN'},
                  { duration : 41,
                    number : '0641268012',
                     direction : 'outbound',
                     serviceProvider : 'MTN'}
                  ];
```

Write some functions called:

* `totalDurationOfCallsWithObjects` that takes in a list of call durations and return the total call duration for all the durations in the list;
* `totalCostForEachCallWith` that takes in a list of call durations an returns a list of total costs for each duration;
* `totalForBillWithObjects` that takes in a list of call duration objects and return the total cost for all the calls.

The cost per second being `5` cents.
